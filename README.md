# Hidden Markov Model

Description: Implemented forward and Viterbi algorithms for an assignment in machine learning. Leveraged Shakespeare database to generate quite a few words as well as given a phrase, determine which sentence is belonged to.

Location: Machine Learning Graduate Course at KU

Dates: Mar 8, 2019 to Mar 25, 2019

## Goal
* Working with Markov Models and generating lines of Shakespeare.

## Data
* Shakespeare Data - 6 features (dataline, play, player's line number, act scene line, player, player's line)

## Analysis
* I performed data rangling on the data sets (i.e., normalized features, combined data sets, removing unrelevant entries, randomizing entries)
* Calculated the number of unique words as states and probabilities between each of those states
* Implemented a Forward and Viterbi Algorithm for a Markov Model

## Results
* Generated a sequence of words as expected!
